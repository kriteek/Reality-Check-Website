<h1> Cages </h1>
<h3> The journey was long and hard. Too hard. Your baby sister didn't survive it.
<h3> Your family is torn apart with grief, but after nearly 7 months you made it to the Arizona border.
<h3> You all were filled with hope, ready for a new start in a safer country.
<h3> You couldn't have been more wrong. </h3>

<h3>You are seperated from your parents and put into an immigration detention facility
<h3>which was essentially a chain linked fence cage.
<h3>All day and night you listen to the wailing of other hungry children.
<h3>Adults and children alike are fainting from dehydration and lack of food.
<h3>Sleep is almost impossible; the lights are left on, you have just a thin
<h3> metallic sheet to protect against the cold and there is nothing to lie down
<h3>on but the hard floor.</h3>

<h3>The conditions are horrible, everything is filthy and there is no air circulating.
<h3>All that your parents are given to eat are half-frozen bologna sandwiches, served at
<h3> 10 in the morning, five in the afternoon and two in the morning.
<h3>All that you are given to eat is a single sugar cookie.
<h3> You knew it was going to be a rough transition, but you had no idea
<h3>that you would be locked in a cage like an animal.
<h3>What has America come to? Has it ever been the land of the free? </h3>
